# Image assets

- **covers/** — Cover images for case studies and project cards (hero/thumbnails).
- **projects/** — Project images (gallery or detail shots per project).

Reference in code as `/images/covers/filename.png` or `/images/projects/filename.jpg`.

**Covers:** Export from Figma at **3× or 4×** so the hero on the case study page stays sharp on large/retina screens (aim for at least ~3000px wide).
