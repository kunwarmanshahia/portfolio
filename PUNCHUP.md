I have 2 punch up ideas.

Idea #1

IDK what to call it yet. It is a standalone website that is meant for users mental health / personal development. Pretty much, it's designed to help users move with actions / intent. It uses AI to deconstruct complex emotions into intentful thinking through a "5 Whys" exercise. It visualizes the results as an interactive experience - where the user can scroll starting from the root cause of their problem (fifth answer), to the beginning of their thoughts (first answer). Each node will provide a sort of written content, alongside links to articles or videos to assist them with the issue they're facing.

This will be a new entry. It expands my work beyond UI and branding by showing interactive UX, AI design, and work with flow & pacing. It demonstrates that I can design empathetic, interactive experiences rather than just static layouts or normal, typical app designs.

Idea #2

Interactive element in my portfolio where a picture of my face is displayed with my eyes following the user’s cursor across the screen; reacts to the user in real time.

This will be added to my existing portfolio as an asset.
